# Prototype of a Mobile App

As a graphic designer student, I should be able to learn, how to work in a graphic industry, which not includes only a logo itself, but also an overall visual communication. I was given a task to create a prototype of a mobile app, that suppose to solve any kind of problem in art industry.

I wanted to create an app, which would search a local galleries and museums around you and give you a recommendations. This would help you with any kind of decision-making, which art movement you like and which donâ€™t.
